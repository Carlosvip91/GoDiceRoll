# GoDiceRoll
Wanna settle some differences with a roll of some dice? Here ya go!

Dice-Game
This project is a simple webpage dedicated to settling a party's differences by rolling dice and deciding a winner. Simply refresh the page to start the game.

A web browser with stable internet connection is all that is needed to use the webpage.

Thoughts on improvement for future updates

Will learn how to use animations to show dice rolling to their outcomes and implement it.
Will add an interactive, dynamic scoring table to keep track of scoring and provide more information.
Maybe add themes such as Casino, Royal, and Casual.
Have certain animations happen when someone has won or lost.
